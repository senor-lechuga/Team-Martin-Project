8 - View their appointments for a given week (Similar to 1)
9 - Record when they have seen a patient, and what treatments were given.

10 - Finish the report
11 - Comment the code?



THINGS NEEDED TO BE DONE DESPERATELY:
- addAppointment needs to work
- updateAppointment needs to be added, or 'addAppointment' changed to make sure it updates if the appointment is already there (paid or not)
        '-> NOTE: A 'setAppointmentToPaid(Appointment a)' method would also work
   - when done, uncomment line 116 in PatientSelector, and look at addStuff.java to test it
- add a type (or 'paymentType') field to the treatments table, so that each treatment can be classed as either a "hygiene", "checkup" or "repair" treatment, so that number 6 can be done.
