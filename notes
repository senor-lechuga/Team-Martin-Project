NOTE:


Things to do:
1 - View all appointments for a *given week*, Calendars.
2 - *Book*, *cancel* and *find* appointments for a given patient
3 - *Book* empty appointment for holiday reasons
//4 - *Subscribe* and *unsubscribe* patient to healthcare plan
5 - *show* all *unpaid* treatments for a given patient
6 - *Modify* the total cost owed by a patient on a healthcare plan
7 - *Record* when a patient has paid their outstanding bill

Things Partners should be able to do:
8 - View their appointments for a given week (Similar to 1)
9 - Record when they have seen a patient, and what treatments were given.


Who'll do it:
Blayze - 4 (then working downwards)



THINGS NEEDED TO BE DONE DESPERATELY:
- addAppointment needs to work
- updateAppointment needs to be added, or 'addAppointment' changed to make sure it updates if the appointment is already there.
        '-> NOTE: A 'setAppointmentToPaid(Appointment a)' method would also work
   - when done, uncomment line 116 in PatientSelector, and look at addStuff.java to test it
